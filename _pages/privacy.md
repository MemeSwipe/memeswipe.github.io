**No personal information is transmitted to or stored on MemeSwipe's servers.**

When you open the app for the first time an anonymous account is created and stored on your device. This account is used to provide you with a personalized feed (eg prevent you from seeing duplicate memes).

If you decide to reinstall the app a new anonymous account is created and no effort is being put into linking that account to any previous accounts you might have had.
